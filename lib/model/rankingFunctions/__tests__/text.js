const text = `I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. What? The flux capacitor. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before.

No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible. Go. Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor. Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly.

Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? What about George? Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985.

The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. Holy shit.

C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history.

Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me. Are those my clocks I hear? Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books?

Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man. Ahh. Ahh. Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury. Good morning.

I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories. Hi, Marty. Doc, is that a de-

Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? Uh, yeah. Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat.

Uh, Doc. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Ahh. Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? Huh?

My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. And he could sleep in my room. Oh. Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine.

Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown. Marty, is that you? No, not yet. Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc

Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand. Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. Hi. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. She's just trying to keep you respectable.

Precisely. Marty, such a nice name. Nothing. You know what I do in those situations? Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next.

Leave her alone, you bastard. Well uh, good, fine. Lorenzo, where're you keys? Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott.

this has gotta be a dream. My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. Marty, that was very interesting music. Marty, that was very interesting music. Yeah.

Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake. Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive.

I followed you. Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake. Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars. Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Doc.

Science Fiction Theater. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy. Children. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date?

That's good advice, Marty. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. I'm writing this down, this is good stuff.

Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. Excuse me. Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you? Excuse me.

Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. Shit. Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it. Hello. What?

Why am I always the last one to know about these things. Right, gimme a Pepsi free. Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you. Watch it, Goldie. Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon.

yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date. He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. Precisely.

whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father. Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date.
